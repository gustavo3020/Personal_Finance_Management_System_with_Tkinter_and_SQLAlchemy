# Personal_Finance_Management_System_with_Tkinter_and_SQLAlchemy
Tired of complex spreadsheets for managing expenses, I developed this tool to simplify daily financial control and provide a clear overview of my financial health.

Key Features:
💰 Transaction Management: Easily add, edit, and delete financial entries;  
💳 Card Control: Dedicated section to track specific expenses from different cards;  
📊 Summary View: Overview dashboard with expense categorization by period;  
📅 Date Navigation: Interactive calendar for period selection;  
🗄️ Data Persistence: Secure data storage using SQLite and SQLAlchemy;  
📤 Excel Import/Export: Seamlessly move your data between the application and Excel spreadsheets;  
⚙️ Modular Structure: Well-organized code in modules (GUI.py, data.py, Main.py) for easy maintenance and scalability.

🌱 Learnings and Next Steps  
This project was fundamental in deepening my knowledge of:

Object-Oriented Programming with Tkinter;  
Modularization and separation of concerns;  
Using SQLAlchemy Core for database interaction;  
Application state management (selected_tab);

Next steps include implementing more advanced filters and reports, new features and explore another UI library.
